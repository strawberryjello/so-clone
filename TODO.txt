Issues
======
- problems with before_action controller callbacks (login_required) while logged out
  - upvote/downvote: login page gets stuffed into vote tally div
  - new answer: nothing happens (routing problem, see old issue)
- ajax error CSS, duplication
  - upvote/downvote jQuery code is duplicated
- deprecation warnings for `to` in routes (while running rspec)
- email address validation
- deleting unused tags

JavaScript
==========
- answer form
- upvote/downvote buttons

Tests
=====
- rspec-rails gem
- modules
- models (unit)
  - validation
  - callbacks
  - methods
- controllers (functional)
  - logic
  - returns

Mentions
========
- ckeditor gem
  - question, answer forms
- question text/answer body parsing
  - probably before saving, since links must be created and saved

Votes
=====
- question upvotes/downvotes
- answer upvotes/downvotes

Bootstrap
=========
- gem: bootstrap-sass (also added: sprockets-rails, autoprefixer-rails)
- views
  - user: view user, user homepage, new (signup)
  - question: new, edit (comma-separated tag string in text field), index (tag list, user)
  - tags: tag list (edit question -> hide 'remove' when not logged in)
  - other forms: change password, forgot password, login, etc
- styles
  - pull up inline styles

Prod
====
- set up test and prod dbs, revert dev to sqlite

Tags
====
- / delete question -> don't delete tags
- / delete tag -> don't delete questions
- / view all tags
- / view all questions for a tag
- / add tags to a question
- / delete tags from a question
- / any characters not allowed? (allow: +, #, -, ...)
- case insensitive tag search
  - using 'like %%', but safely -> see Rails security guide (examples use '= ?' instead of 'like ?', but principle is the same)
  - clicking the search button while the search field is empty should trigger the 'No matches found' condition
- / case insensitive tag saving (SO seems to do this lol)

Auth
====
- signup (new user), login
- restricted actions/pages
- hashing
- email validation regex

User actions
============

- Answer
  - list all (for a question), new, save, edit, update (, delete)
- User

Advanced features
=================

Old issues
==========
- sanitizing fails on tags
  - moved to Tag.parse_tag_string, where there's already a check for existing tags
- sanitizing user input from ckeditor
  - calls to sanitize in model prior to validation, using the sanitize tag in views
- question and answer votes not being saved? -> verify
  - problem with variable scope, no longer relevant due to updated voting architecture
- user ID not being saved in answers table
  - logged in user not being associated to newly created answer in controller
- CSS classes with bad names (.bottom-margin, .top-margin)
- delete answer confirmation popup appears more than once
  - broken HAML formatting in application.html.haml put the JS includes in the body, which forced the page to reload the popup JS several times
- mailer can't parse HAML files
- no validation errors for new answer (what object do you refer to? -> build creates the empty object in the answers collection, not yet saved)
  - just used a flash error message when save fails
- delete question -> cascade to answers
- rendering newlines in question/answer text (use an editor (gem))
- adding foreign keys to existing tables (drop/create is fine for dev db)
- new answer ajax submission
  - empty answer results in http 500 error -> ajax not completed (ie, ajax:complete not triggered)
    - separate .js.erb for error display
  - no JS for submitting an answer while logged out (replacement for redirect in ApplicationController.loginRequired)
- new answer doesn't require login (problem with request.fullpath in login_required action)
  - now that it's required, has routing problem (offline form submission creates a GET request even if generated form specifies POST, so not routed correctly)
