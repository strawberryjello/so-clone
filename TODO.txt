Issues
======
- delete answer confirmation popup appears more than once
- mailer can't parse HAML files
- new answer doesn't require login (problem with request.fullpath in login_required action)
- no validation errors for new answer (what object do you refer to? -> build creates the empty object in the answers collection, not yet saved)
- delete question -> cascade to answers
- rendering newlines in question/answer text (use an editor (gem))
- adding foreign keys to existing tables (drop/create is fine for dev db)

Tags
====
- / delete question -> don't delete tags
- / delete tag -> don't delete questions
- / view all tags
- / view all questions for a tag
- / add tags to a question
- / delete tags from a question
- / any characters not allowed? (allow: +, #, -, ...)
- case insensitive tag search
  - using 'like %%', but safely -> how?
- / case insensitive tag saving (SO seems to do this lol)

Auth
====
- signup (new user), login
- restricted actions/pages
- hashing
- email validation regex

User actions
============
- view own questions/answers
- edit own/other users' questions/answers

Style guide
===========
- hashes (use =>)
- HAML
  - answer: answer (show), form
  - question: index, new, show, edit, form

Models
======
- Question
  - title, body, timestamp, date modified
  - has many: tags, answers
- Answer
  - body, timestamp, date modified
- User
  - username, password, email
  - has many: questions, answers
- Tag
  - name

Controllers
===========
- Question
  - list all, view, new, save, edit, update (, delete -> cascade)
- Answer
  - list all (for a question), new, save, edit, update (, delete)
- User
  - list all, new, save, edit, update (, delete -> preserve questions/answers but show user as deleted -> is this possible?)
- Tag
  - list all, list all questions, new, edit (, delete -> questions will be untagged)

Views
=====
- landing page (all questions?)
- new/edit question (partial)
  - add (can create new)/remove tags
- view question
  - split this up into partials (question, answers, answer form)
- edit answer (see new answer partial)
- user sign up page

Tests
=====
- models
  - validation
  - persistence? how is this tested?
- controllers
  - logic

Advanced features
=================
- reputation
- votes for answers
- user mentions
- best answer
- comments (questions and answers)
