A simple StackOverflow clone. Written while learning Rails 4.2.

References used (original code modified where applicable):

- [Getting Started with Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/v4.2.0/getting_started.html) (official documentation)

- [Basic User Authentication in Rails](http://www.aidanf.net/posts/rails-authentication-tutorial) (old but relevant)

**NOTE:** I used this project to test a Jenkins CI installation from January to March 2016; the commits during that period are all trivial, since I was trying to trigger builds via Github webhooks.
